Work page: drafted case study sections

A) OCSC Sailing (ocsc.com) — draft section

Title: OCSC Sailing
Subtitle: Booking + fleet management integrated with the website
Hero image: homepage or booking/calendar UI (your best “system” screenshot)

Context
OCSC was a high-traffic San Francisco Bay sailing school and club in Berkeley. I maintained and evolved the platform over multiple years and led a major redesign that shifted the experience from an older PHP-style content structure toward a clearer, task-first information architecture.

What I did
• Maintained and steadily improved the website over 8 years
• Led a full redesign focused on clarity, usability, and conversion paths for key member actions
• Integrated the website with a CRM / fleet management booking system
• Supported owners managing blackout dates for co-owned boats
• Improved reservation and enrollment flows tied to member portal actions (e.g., reservations, crewlist, calendar)
• Reorganized IA around core journeys (Learn to Sail, Charter, Club, Events, Vacations, Team Building)

Outcome
• Members could self-serve reservations and course enrollment with less staff overhead
• Booking rules and availability stayed accurate across owners, members, and staff
• A more modern, reliable web experience better supported day-to-day operations, not just marketing pages

Stack / notes
API integrations with CRM/fleet management + member portal links + CMS-driven content architecture

Essential questions (so I don’t invent details) 1. Are you okay naming the CRM/booking system (or keep it generic)? 2. Any concrete outcomes you can safely claim? (e.g., “reduced admin time,” “fewer booking conflicts,” “more online signups”) Even 1–2 helps.

B) Rockefeller Lodge (rockefellerlodge.com)

Title: Rockefeller Lodge
Subtitle: Premium bilingual venue site with modern UX
Hero image: the home hero (garden/venue) or an events gallery/lightbox moment

Context
Rockefeller Lodge needed a website that felt elegant and approachable, showcased the venue setting, and guided visitors toward booking-oriented actions.

What I did
• Organized domain/hosting and built a future-proof responsive site
• Designed wireframes and a high-fidelity prototype before build
• Implemented bilingual UX with a simple language toggle (EN/ES)
• Structured key venue messaging around atmosphere, capacity, accessibility, and event types
• Built a media-forward experience and clear inquiry flow with CTA emphasis on tours/contact

Outcome
• Clearer venue story and practical decision details for prospective guests
• A polished, mobile-friendly experience for exploring events and requesting tours
• A bilingual site experience to serve a broader local audience

Stack / notes
Responsive marketing site with bilingual routing/content and media-forward components

Tiny site-specific cues (grounded)
• Site highlights serene setting, capacity (150 overall / 100 indoor), accessibility, and “Request a Tour” conversion.

Essential questions 1. Do you want the case study to mention exact capacity numbers (150 total / 100 indoor) publicly? 2. Should we keep tech phrasing generic, or name the exact framework used?

C) Spirit Rock (spiritrock.org) — draft section (with site context)

Title: Spirit Rock Meditation Center
Subtitle: Scalable platform for programs, content, and registration
Hero image: homepage, programs listing, calendar/PDP UI, or a “platform” screenshot that shows scale

Context
Spirit Rock delivers a broad mix of retreats, classes, and daylong programs (on-land and online), alongside an extensive Dharma/content library and donation ecosystem.

What I did
• Helped expand the platform from primarily in-person offerings into a robust online + hybrid ecosystem (starting 2020)
• Supported information architecture and UX patterns across a growing catalog of programs and resources
• Worked on integrations between the website and registration systems (including external retreat booking flows)
• Helped standardize scalable templates/components for programs, teacher content, and discovery pathways

Outcome
• A web platform that supports multiple program types and a large, evolving catalog
• Clearer discovery paths for new and returning visitors across programs and learning journeys
• Reduced friction for staff and users through better-structured content and integrated registration journeys

Stack / notes
CMS-driven platform + registration integrations (including retreat booking flows) + scalable content architecture

Title: TonySamour.com
Subtitle: Consultant brand site with secure contact and Cloudflare deployment
Hero image: homepage hero or contact form section with trust/CTA focus

Context
This project was built as a premium freelance consultant website that balances editorial clarity, performance, and conversion. The goal was to create a calm, high-trust experience while keeping the stack lean and easy to maintain.

What I did

• Built reusable UI components and a consistent design system with strong accessibility defaults
• Implemented responsive navigation, mobile UX polish, and semantic structure throughout
• Hardened contact workflows with Turnstile verification, honeypot protection, and rate limiting
